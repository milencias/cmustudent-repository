My public portfolio page for my Telling Stories with Data class at Carnegie Mellon University!

# About me
Here are a few things about me: 
My name is Milencia Saintus and I use she/her pronouns. I am a first masters year student at Heinz College. I am studying Public Policy and Management. A fun fact about me is that my birthday falls on Thanksgiving every couple of years. My hobbies include, reading, hiking, watching tv, learning anything and everything, working out, and completing puzzles! I am interested in all thing data, manipulating data, extracting insights from data, presenting data, etc. I am also VERY excited about this class!

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn:
  1. Better ways to make my data visualizations accesible for all.
  2. Color theory to make my data visualizations more effective and engaging.
  3. How to best assess the most effective graphic for the story I am trying to tell with my data.
  4. Once I graduate, I plan on becoming a data scientist, so this class is very important in my development as I will be working with data all the time.
