# Step four: test the solution
**First classmate response:**
- Can you tell me what you think this is?

I think this is communicating how percentages of populations (in different countries) having access to sewage changed from ~1960-2019

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

I think it's telling me that many populations around the world might have had very little access to plumbing/sewage 60 years ago but that those proportions have since changed drastically and might be near 100% access in much of the world now.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Nothing comes right to mind...but I think what I wrote for the last question might sort of apply to this q as well :-)

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

-Maybe an international development-type audience, non-profit audience?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Maybe tweak the title a bit. When the reader sees the visualization, they'll quickly see it's countries, so you could consider dropping that? The 'connected to' in the title also confused me on the first read (so it took a little longer to comprehend)...can't immediately think of how to change that though!

A part of me wanted to consider a one-color gradient (more pop % = darker color) across the board just so people would not have to rely on the percentage color key as much (because it doesn't have the advantage of perfect intuition, I guess (like repub red, democrat blue). But I'm thinking it might be really tricky to do that and it might not communicate your intended statistics as well (if it was important to easily distinguish between the percentage ranges, for example).

Another color thought that occured to me - because this data may vary really widely between regions, it (might!) be bordering on rainbow-y if ordered alphabetically...so I was thinking you could consider grouping by region so that someone could quickly pick up on patterns? Totally TBD though based on how it ends up looking!

**Second classmate response:**
It looks like this is intending to show the percentage of people in each country who live near sewage plants. It seems like the intended audience would be government entities and authorities. I was a little confused by the colors chosen for this graphic, since I tend to associate red with higher/worse numbers. I would have assumed that red indicates that a massive proportion of the population is connected to sewage plants. I would probably use a yellow-red scale or something similar, with yellow being low percentages and red being high percentages. I also would move the x-axis label to the bottom. I'm confused by why it is presented on the top of the graph instead of the bottom - it doesn't seem to add anything in changing where it is positioned. I also would love to see what part of the graph I should focus on. Since it currently shows the state of each country spanning decades, it's hard to know what the point is. Maybe it would be helpful to focus on one region or country? Or a certain year? I personally would find it helpful to see actual percentages, instead of a general color spectrum indicating ranges. I think you can demonstrate the significance of the colors differently and show percentages of the main information you want your audience to focus on. :)
