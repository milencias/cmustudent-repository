# Step one: find a data visualization
<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6w7I" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6w7I" target="_blank">OECD Chart: Wastewater treatment, Total, Percentage, Annual, 1960 â€“ 2019</a></iframe>

-I chose this visualization because I thought it was presenting on a very important topic. I am interested in environmental issues, especially equitable environmental policies, so I thought it would be great to present the data in a more engaging and effective way. 

-The critique showed me that it is very important to make sure that your data visualization is not only catered for seasoned professionals who will be looking at you graphic. You need to make sure that it is accessible to anyone that looks at it. In order to do that, you have to make sure it is aesthetically pleasing, intuitive, engaging, useful, etc. It has to make people want to know more about the topic. If people don't engage with your visualization because it's not accesible, then it is not a useful visualization. 

# Step three: wireframe a solution
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-heatmap" data-src="visualisation/7780398"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
-I thought a heatmap would best show the procession of wastewater treatment in the world. It would be easy to follow with the colors and labeling. 
-I also thought the heatmap would be intuitive, engaging, and useful for everyone interacting with the visualization, no matter their knowledge base.

# Step four: test the solution
**First classmate response:**
- Can you tell me what you think this is?

I think this is communicating how percentages of populations (in different countries) having access to sewage changed from ~1960-2019

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

I think it's telling me that many populations around the world might have had very little access to plumbing/sewage 60 years ago but that those proportions have since changed drastically and might be near 100% access in much of the world now.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Nothing comes right to mind...but I think what I wrote for the last question might sort of apply to this q as well :-)

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

-Maybe an international development-type audience, non-profit audience?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Maybe tweak the title a bit. When the reader sees the visualization, they'll quickly see it's countries, so you could consider dropping that? The 'connected to' in the title also confused me on the first read (so it took a little longer to comprehend)...can't immediately think of how to change that though!

A part of me wanted to consider a one-color gradient (more pop % = darker color) across the board just so people would not have to rely on the percentage color key as much (because it doesn't have the advantage of perfect intuition, I guess (like repub red, democrat blue). But I'm thinking it might be really tricky to do that and it might not communicate your intended statistics as well (if it was important to easily distinguish between the percentage ranges, for example).

Another color thought that occured to me - because this data may vary really widely between regions, it (might!) be bordering on rainbow-y if ordered alphabetically...so I was thinking you could consider grouping by region so that someone could quickly pick up on patterns? Totally TBD though based on how it ends up looking!

**Second classmate response:**
It looks like this is intending to show the percentage of people in each country who live near sewage plants. It seems like the intended audience would be government entities and authorities. I was a little confused by the colors chosen for this graphic, since I tend to associate red with higher/worse numbers. I would have assumed that red indicates that a massive proportion of the population is connected to sewage plants. I would probably use a yellow-red scale or something similar, with yellow being low percentages and red being high percentages. I also would move the x-axis label to the bottom. I'm confused by why it is presented on the top of the graph instead of the bottom - it doesn't seem to add anything in changing where it is positioned. I also would love to see what part of the graph I should focus on. Since it currently shows the state of each country spanning decades, it's hard to know what the point is. Maybe it would be helpful to focus on one region or country? Or a certain year? I personally would find it helpful to see actual percentages, instead of a general color spectrum indicating ranges. I think you can demonstrate the significance of the colors differently and show percentages of the main information you want your audience to focus on. :)

# Step five: build your solution

-I looked at all of my critiques seriously and thought about how I could best take everything into account to make my visualization the most effective. I saw that the color scheme was something that came up a lot so I changed it from the red-blue gradient to just a blue-teal gradient. I also added the percentages inside of the gradient so that people are able to see  them clearly. 
-I also added filters for the audience to engage with. If they wanted to see the whole dataset from 1960-2020 they could. I also added the filter of The North American Union. I thought it would be good to select countries from the dataset like one of my critiquers told me. So I shifted the focus of the visualization to how Mexico, Canada, and the United States do in terms of their wastewater treatment. This gives the visualization a purpose so that the audience knows exactly what they are looking at/for. Instead of just having a big visualization for the audience to try to understand the purpose of, giving them a sense of direction helps them engage with the your visualization more and spark a want to learn more about what you're presenting.
