# Outline
## High-level Summary
This project is going to show how low-income and minority communities of color face disproportionate effects of climate change and pollution.

## Project Structure
  1. Setup: We are facing an evironmental crisis in America. 
  2. Conflict: We will not be able to effectively combat climate change and pollution if we do not adress the rampant environmental racism in America.
  3. Resolution: If we setup new initiatives in these communities, use AI and data science to redeisng zoning laws and cut out gerrymandering, we will be able to reach our climate goals and reduce pollution.

##### Introduction
  1. Brief introduction to the climate crisis in America. Failing water pipes that leak lead, incinerators in communites causing lung cancer, etc.
  2. Brief introduction to how low-income, Hispanic, Black, and minority communities disproportionately face the impact of climate change.
    - Show statistics on how pollution affects these communities more.
    - Things like incinerators are more likely to be built in the low-income communities.
