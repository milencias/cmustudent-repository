# Outline
## High-level Summary
This project is going to show how low-income and minority communities of color face disproportionate effects of climate change and pollution.

## Project Structure
  1. Setup: We are facing an evironmental crisis in America. 
  2. Conflict: We will not be able to effectively combat climate change and pollution if we do not adress the rampant environmental racism in America.
  3. Resolution: If we setup new initiatives in these communities, use AI and data science to redeisng zoning laws and cut out gerrymandering, we will be able to reach our climate goals and reduce pollution.

##### Introduction
  1. Brief introduction to the climate crisis in America. Failing water pipes that leak lead, incinerators in communites causing lung cancer, etc.

##### Conflict
  2. Introduction to how low-income, Hispanic, Black, and minority communities disproportionately face the impact of climate change.
    - Show statistics on how pollution affects these communities more.
    - Things like incinerators are more likely to be built in the low-income communities. 

##### Resolution
  3. How they can take action and get involved.
    - Write letters to representatives. 
    - Bills to support.
    - Organizations actively doing the work to combat these issues, like Clean Water Action.

Make sure to show the sucess stories of the organizations I am recommending so that people are not disillusioned.

The two places I plan on getting 

# Method and Medium
The medium that I plan on using with the Final Project is Shorthand. I have been experimenting with it and I think it will be the best place to showcase my final project. I want to build a specific story tying in how crucial it is for people to understand that we will never effectively comabt climate change and pollution if we do not focus on the low-income and minority communities of color who bear the brunt of environmental issues. Shorthand will allow me to be able to have an engaging presentation that will convince people to learn more about my topic and want to take action.

I also plan on using Tableau and Flourish to create my data visualizations.
