# Data Visualization 1 
Letâ€™s look at general government debt in 2020. This graph is taken from the OECD site.

# Data Visualization 2
Now let's look at general government debt from 1995 to 2019.

The second visualization was good but it could've be better. I created this third visualization to be clearer. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7690426"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

The data that I visualized is telling the story of general government debt from 1995-2020. What the general government debt-to-GDP ratio does is measure the gross debt of the GDP in a country as the percentage of that country's GDP. A country's GDP is a crucial factor in learning how tenable the country's current financial strategies are. This data allows the audience to not only track a country's debt-to-GDP ratio at the base level, but it also helps the audience go further to dive deeper to understand how a country's financial policy affected its GDP.

For the third visualization, I used a grouped column chart rather than the simple line chart in data visualization 2. I did this because I wanted my audience to get a clear picture of the size comparisons of the debt-to-GDP ratio throughout the years. I also favored the grouped column chart because it gives the audience a much better view of the debt-to-GDP ratio throughout the years because the line chart only has 4 labels starting from 2000 and ending in 2018, which does not give the audience a very clear view of the time span. The grouped colunmn chart has 5 labels and starts from 1995 and ends at 2019. This is a much better way of visualizaing the data because the audience has a clear view of where debt-to-GDP started and finished. I also chose the grouped column chart because it shows the audience exacttly where the data stops. Overall, I think the grouped column chart does a really great job of presenting the data.
